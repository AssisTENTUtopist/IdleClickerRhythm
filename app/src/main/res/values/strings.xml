    <string name="intro">The game is supposed to improve your Sense of Bar™ by giving you an opportunity to click once a period.
        The game consists of three parts:\n
        in the first part you assign a duration in beats per minutes(the default interval is 120 bpm (half a second));
        \n
        in the second part the game starts (click on the screen once per period), and ends by pressing the big red button;
        \n
        in the third part your results summarize. And remember: the longer you play, the more accurate your result.
